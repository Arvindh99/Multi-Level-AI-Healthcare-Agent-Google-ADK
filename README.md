### Multi-Level AI Healthcare Agent (Google ADK)

This project demonstrates a robust, safety-focused Multi-Level Agent System built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). The system functions as a Triage Assistant, gathering user symptoms, classifying them into a medical specialty, and locating the nearest appropriate clinic—without performing unsafe medical diagnosis.
